A February Project (starting January 31) 

**What’s the big idea?**  
For 30 days, do something in KiCAD. What that something looks like is all up to you.

The 30 days project was inspired by Sophy Wong’s 31 Days of Fusion 360 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9jChZtsVhA and Malcom Gladwell’s 10,000 hour proposition https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/complexity-and-the-ten-thousand-hour-rule. 

While I am not a complete beginner and have tinkered with KiCad casually, I find myself having to relearn quite a bit when I come back since many months usually pass between projects. Generally I am hoping to improve my fluency and muscle memory in the software, and to expand my experience by working through a small project without any deadline pressure.

**Wait, I’m New! What even _IS_ KiCAD?**  
"A Cross Platform and Open Source Electronics Design Automation Suite"

**OK…**


>Electronic design automation (EDA), also referred to as electronic computer-aided design (ECAD),[1] is a category of software tools for designing electronic systems such as integrated circuits and printed circuit boards (PCBs).
>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation

So in short, KiCad is a tool for creating custom circuit boards and PCB Art, including electronic badges. `#badgelife`. 

There are other tools out there, but I am mainly interested in focusing on KiCad for now. It’s free, open source, and a pretty awesome tool once you get going.

Here are some projects designed in KiCad:

**What's next?**  
More KiCad! More tinkering! More Schematics and Designs! Run DRC. Then Run DRC some more.  

Build an SAO Board.  

Create a design for an electronic badge or PCB art piece. 
Send your design to a fabrication shop and bring that baby to life!
